    "text": "Examples of D&D-Style Challenges\nHere are concrete examples of challenges tailored to the rotating DM format you described. Each is designed for a 5-player group session (45-60 minutes), drawing directly from key readings. The DM narrates in a immersive, fantasy voice, presents challenges one at a time, and adjudicates dice rolls (e.g., d20 + “Wisdom” for insight, “Charisma” for persuasion).\n\nSuccess thresholds: DC 10-15 (easy for basic grasp, hard for nuance). High roll = insight/reward; low = complication/objection.\nPlayer actions: Ask a question (probe text) or suggest a solution (defend position). Others chime in with counters/considerations.\nPre-gen characters: Assign avatars like “The Skeptic” (epistemology focus) or “The Judge” (law focus) for roleplay.\n\nI’ve structured them for Philosophy of Law (Hart vs. Fuller) and Introduction to Philosophy (Plato’s Republic as a dungeon). Use a simple cheat sheet for DM notes.\n\n1. Philosophy of Law: Hart vs. Fuller Debate (The Hart-Fuller Debate or Nazi Law Examples)\nDM Setup Narrative: “Your party of royal advisors enters the Tyrant’s Courtroom Dungeon. A despotic king has issued a ‘valid’ decree: All villagers with blue eyes must report for ‘relocation’ at dawn. The scribe shows the signed edict—properly promulgated. But whispers say it’s a death sentence. Is this law? Obey or rebel? Roll Initiative for Justice!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge #\nDescription (DM Presents)\nPlayer Responses & Dice Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n1: Validity of the Law (Hart’s Positivism)\n“The edict meets all formal rules: clear, public, prospective. The king asks: ‘Is this law, even if evil?’”\n- Question: “What makes a rule ‘law’?” (Roll Wisdom: 15+ → “Hart says yes—law is source-based, not moral.” Low → Blind obedience trap.)- Suggestion: “It’s law; validity ≠ morality.” (Charisma roll: Success → Party gains ‘Legal Shield’ boon; Fail → Moral doubt debuff.)- Others: Counter with Fuller’s “inner morality” → Roll for objection.\n\n\n2: Morality of the Law (Fuller’s 8 Principles)\n“A villager pleads: The edict is retroactive—blue-eyed kids born yesterday are doomed! Does this void it?”\n- Question: “What are Fuller’s principles (generality, non-retroactivity, etc.)?” (Intelligence roll: 12+ → Reveals flaw; Low → Party accused of treason.)- Suggestion: “Rebel—immoral laws aren’t true law!” (Dexterity ‘stealth rebel’ roll: Success → Free villagers; Fail → Guards summon.)- Others: Hart counter (“Separability thesis!”) → Group vote/rolls resolve.\n\n\n3: Resolution Dilemma\n“The king offers: Enforce it for gold, or challenge in court? Your choice echoes through the dungeon.”\n- Collective rolls build “Justice Meter.” High total → Overthrow tyrant (Fuller win); Low → Enrich but haunted (Hart win). Debrief: When does law fail?\n\n\n\nDM Tips: Prep 8 Fuller principles as “artifacts.” Total session: 3 challenges → Philosophical “boss fight” resolution.\n\n\n2. Introduction to Philosophy: Plato’s Republic (Justice & the Cave as Dungeon)\nDM Setup Narrative: “You awaken chained in the Cave of Shadows—Plato’s Republic unfolds as your prison. Flickering firelight casts puppet illusions on the wall: ‘thrones,’ ‘wars,’ ‘gold.’ A voice (Socrates) whispers: ‘What is justice? Break free or stay comfy?’ Your pre-gen avatars (Guardian, Philosopher, Artisan) must navigate to the sunlight exit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge #\nDescription (DM Presents)\nPlayer Responses & Dice Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n1: Defining Justice (Book I)\n“A shadowy ‘thief’ steals from the ‘rich man’ illusion. The cave echoes: ‘Is justice helping friends or the stronger ruling?’ (Thrasymachus taunt).”\n- Question: “What did Polemarchus/Cephalus say?” (Wisdom roll: 10+ → “Justice as repayment?” Low → Tricked by illusion.)- Suggestion: “Justice is soul harmony” (Plato tease). (Constitution roll: Success → Break one chain; Fail → Headache debuff.)- Others: Debate counters → Roll Perception for “shadow flaws.”\n\n\n2: The Ideal City Escape (Books II-IV)\n“To flee, build a ‘just city’ in the cave: Guardians train, producers craft. But corruption spreads—luxury tempts!”\n- Question: “Why ban poetry/myths?” (Intelligence roll: 13+ → Purify city; Low → Demoralized party.)- Suggestion: “Philosopher-kings rule!” (Charisma roll: Success → Unlock tunnel; Fail → Faction revolt.)- Others: Add classes (waves, auxiliaries) → Group rolls scale city “health.”\n\n\n3: Sunlight Revelation (Books VI-VII, Cave Allegory)\n“You reach the exit: Blinding sun! Puppets were lies. Return to free others? They mock you as mad.”\n- Question: “Forms vs. shadows—what’s real?” (Insight roll: 15+ → Vision quest boon; Low → Blinded retreat.)- Suggestion: “Descend as educators.” (Strength roll: Success → Convert prisoners; Fail → Stoned as heretic.)- Others: Resistance rolls → “Allegory boss”: High total → Party ascends enlightened.\n\n\n\nDM Tips: Use printed “shadow puppets” (simple drawings) as props. Debrief: How does the Cave mirror epistemology? Link to course: “Roll d20: What is reality?”\nThese are plug-and-play—scale difficulty by reading depth. For more (e.g., Descartes’ evil demon as a trap room or Mill’s utilitarianism trolley trap), specify topics! This keeps sessions fun, fair, and deeply philosophical. 🎲"

And this is by no means so difficult a task as the history of philoso- phy would lead one to suppose. For if there are any questions which science leaves it to philosophy to answer, a straightforward process of elimination must lead to their discovery. [Alfred Jules Ayer, Language, Truth, and Logic]"

I will only grade 8 or your best reflections.\nReflective Analysis 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\nEssay 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\nPresentation: Your grade in this area depends on your preparation and participation in the DND class meetings. We will use the dnd adventure sheet linked here to gage participation.\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned. The components are as follows:\n\nThere are four possible point values for each category:\n\nAn unacceptable category area is worth 1/4 of the possible points for that category.\nOne that needs improvement is worth 1/2 of the possible points for that category.\nA good submission is worth 3/4s of the possible points for that category.\nAn excellent submission will be awarded full points.\n\nFor each type of assignment, you will be graded on:\n\nIt’s thesis\nThe premises supporting the thesis\nThe support offered for those premises\nYour evaluation of the material.\n\n\nThesis (main conclusion of the reading)\n\nExcellent: A single, clear, obvious statement of your main point.\nGood: The thesis is present and fairly obvious, but not stated in one sharp sentence.\nNeeds Improvement: You have to dig through the paper to find or reconstruct the thesis.\nUnacceptable: No real thesis at all.\n\n\n\nPremises (the reasons supporting the thesis)\n\nExcellent: Every reason is clearly stated (ideally in single sentences), you distinguish premises taken as given from those you defend, you provide sub-arguments for controversial claims, and the basic premises are at least plausibly true.\nGood: Premises are mostly clear (though maybe not always single statements), sub-arguments appear for controversial points, and basic premises are plausible.\nNeeds Improvement: Premises are hard to identify, unclear which are basic vs. defended, missing sub-arguments for controversial claims, or basic premises are questionable.\nUnacceptable: No real premises, or the premises are very likely false.\n\n\n\nSupport (how well, logical, valid, sound?, the premises actually justify the thesis)\n\nExcellent: The premises clearly and strongly support the thesis; the argument is either logically valid or makes the conclusion very plausible.\nGood: Premises support the thesis reasonably well; the argument is valid or at least makes the conclusion plausible.\nNeeds Improvement: Premises only weakly support the thesis; the argument is invalid and the conclusion isn’t really made plausible.\nUnacceptable: The premises do not support the thesis at all.\n\n\n\nStudent Response (how you handle objections/counter-arguments)\n\nExcellent: You thoughtfully address both obvious and less obvious objections, counterexamples, or opposing views, and give original or insightful replies.\nGood: You address the most obvious objections and give reasonable responses.\nNeeds Improvement: You miss some obvious objections, or your responses are weak/empty (e.g., just saying “this is wrong” without explanation).\nUnacceptable: You ignore objections, counterarguments, and opposing positions completely.\n\nThis rubric rewards clear, well-structured, carefully defended, and critically aware philosophical writing. The strongest papers have a sharp thesis, transparent and plausible reasoning, strong logical support, and serious engagement with possible criticisms.\n\n\nAttendance (5% of final grade, 32 points):\n\nBased on unexcused absences throughout the semester.\n\nGrading Scale (equal increments of 8 points):\n\n\n\n0–1\nunexcused absences:\n32 points\n\n\n2\nunexcused absences:\n24 points\n\n\n3–4\nunexcused absences:\n16 points\n\n\n5–6\nunexcused absences:\n8 points\n\n\n6\nunexcused absences:\n0 points"

    "section": "Two Questions about Perception",
    "text": "Two Questions about Perception\n\nCan we improve the way we perceive the world around us?\nHow does education foster better perception of the world around us?\n\n\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

He was a Fransiscan and was a master of theology and philosophy having studied theology at the University of Paris. He was also a Minister General, some kind of high ranking official. He is best known for his The Journey of the Mind into God.\nAs the following quote shows, Bonaventure was not only committed to theology, but philosophy which according to him, was a method of better understanding the beliefs he held. It is important to note that this practice was important even for what he considered matters of faith, suppositions held when the facts supporting those are not fully grasped.",

This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine."

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Two Questions about Perception\n\nCan we improve the way we perceive the world around us?\nHow does education foster better perception of the world around us?\n\n\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine."

This means that everything in nature has a purpose or end (telos) that it is directed towards.\nThis include:\n\nends\ngoals\nand purposes\n\n\nBut what are these and do we necessarily have access to them? The person who intends to rob a bank because it is enjoyable, is that person really pursuing the goal of robbery? Or is the goal something else? Is the goal of robbery really enjoyment? If so, then what is the goal of enjoyment? Is it pleasure? If so, then what is the goal of pleasure? Is it happiness? If so, then what is the goal of happiness?"

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), “the power of man cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety.” And further on: “Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still more?” Therefore, happiness does not consist in power.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

But honor is not in the honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore, happiness does not consist in honor.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

For those who receive false fame, must needs blush at their own praise.” Therefore, man’s happiness does not consist in fame or glory.

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

Establishing Genre Boundaries\nThe third element of this work includes the establishment and employment of genre.\n\nFor Aristotle, genre is a scheme of enquiry that seeks to provide conditions through which mimetic concepts such as media, mimetic objects, and modes are delimited. In other words, he develops:\nConditions for categorizing this class of object\nConcepts that relate to this class of object\nModes of inquiry in which to explore items in this class of object\n\n\n\nasserts the significance of formal design and unity for both the composition and the appreciation of literary works, and to offer a conception of artistic form which relates it to the organic forms crucial to his understanding of nature. [(hall95?), 10; 50b34-51a6]\n\n\n\nAlthough we might call this approach ‘formalist’, a question arises about the necessity of genre concepts inferred in a particular mimetic example.\n\nFor instance, he references Plato’s analysis of mimetic modes in Ch. III of this work.\nHowever, for Aristotle, mimesis is an attempt to understand the broader world, by reference to the human propensity to represent human experiences through fictive representation, and imaginative reenactment.\nIn this way, Aristotle likely hopes to connect art to human nature as a capacity for human desire to understand universal concepts whether moral, religious, ethical, or relational.",

    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine."

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good.

For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "De Musica\n\nWe must not hate what is below us, but rather with God’s help put it in its right place, setting in right order what is below us, ourselves, and what is above us, and not being offended by the lower, but delighting only in the higher.\n\n\nDe Musica is one of Augustine’s lesser known treatises. More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz."

This means that everything in nature has a purpose or end (telos) that it is directed towards.\nThis include:\n\nends\ngoals\nand purposes\n\n\nBut what are these and do we necessarily have access to them? The person who intends to rob a bank because it is enjoyable, is that person really pursuing the goal of robbery? Or is the goal something else? Is the goal of robbery really enjoyment? If so, then what is the goal of enjoyment? Is it pleasure? If so, then what is the goal of pleasure? Is it happiness? If so, then what is the goal of happiness?"

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

    "text": "Article 4\n\nOn the contrary, Happiness is the perfect good. But power is most imperfect. For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), “the power of man cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety.” And further on: “Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still more?” Therefore, happiness does not consist in power.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

But honor is not in the honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore, happiness does not consist in honor.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

For those who receive false fame, must needs blush at their own praise.” Therefore, man’s happiness does not consist in fame or glory.

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Overall Course Setup\n\nGroup Structure: By the second week, students form small groups of 5 members each.\nRotating Dungeon Master (DM) Role: Every group member gets one turn to act as the Dungeon Master (DM) for a full session/day.\n\nThis distributes workload fairly—no one is stuck doing all the prep.\nThe DM takes ownership of that day’s reading/topic, transforming it into a D&D-style adventure.\n\n\n\n\nSession Format (When a Student is DM)\n\nPresentation of the Reading\n\nThe DM presents the assigned philosophical text (e.g., a reading on justice, legal positivism, natural law, authority, rights, punishment, or core intro topics like knowledge/reality) structured as a D&D adventure.\n\nThink narrative framing: The group is a party of adventurers (or avatars embodying philosophical positions).\nThe reading becomes the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/legal dilemma in a kingdom, a trial in a courtroom-cave, or a riddle posed by a sphinx representing a philosopher.\n\n\nChallenges Presented One at a Time\n\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially (like encounters in a dungeon).\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nA village demands obedience to an unjust law → Debate duty to obey.\nA trial with conflicting evidence → Explore legal interpretation or epistemology of testimony.\nA trolley-like scenario in a fantasy context → Apply ethics/law theories.\n\n\n\nGroup Interaction & Participation\n\nFor each challenge:\n\nAny group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response in character (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player rolls dice (typically a d20 + relevant modifier, like “Intelligence for reasoning” or “Charisma for persuasion”) to determine the outcome/strength of their idea.\nSuccess → Advances the “quest,” strengthens the argument, or reveals new insight.\nFailure → Complication, objection, or setback (e.g., a logical fallacy is exposed).\n\n\n\nCollaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\n\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOther group members get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., alternative interpretations, edge cases, or objections from the reading).\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\nResolution & Reflection\n\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (like a traditional DM).\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy of law or intro questions?\n\n\n\nWhy This Works for Philosophy (Especially Philosophy of Law)\n\nTurns abstract texts into experiential “living” philosophy—students defend positions, face consequences, and see ideas clash.\nDice rolls simulate uncertainty in reasoning (e.g., a brilliant argument might “fail” due to poor delivery, or a flawed one succeed by luck—prompting reflection on persuasion vs. truth).\nRotating DM role builds skills in presentation, facilitation, and creative application of ideas.\nSmall groups (5) ensure everyone participates actively.\n\nThis structure is innovative but aligns with existing experiments in using D&D/RPGs to teach philosophy (e.g., ethics courses with group quests or embodying philosophers as characters). It keeps sessions engaging, hands-on, and true to the spirit of philosophical inquiry as a shared adventure in reasoning! If you’d like examples of challenges for specific topics (e.g., Hart vs. Fuller on law, or Plato’s Republic as a dungeon), let me know.\n\n\nExamples\n\nExamples of D&D-Style Challenges\nThese are concrete examples of challenges the DM for a given week may use. Each is designed for a 5-player group session (45-60 minutes), drawing directly from key readings. The DM narrates in a immersive, fantasy voice, presents challenges one at a time, and adjudicates dice rolls (e.g., d20 + “Wisdom” for insight, “Charisma” for persuasion).\n\nSuccess thresholds: DC 10-15 (easy for basic grasp, hard for nuance). High roll = insight/reward; low = complication/objection.\nPlayer actions: Ask a question (probe text) or suggest a solution (defend position). Others chime in with counters/considerations.\nPre-gen characters: Assign avatars like “The Skeptic” (epistemology focus) or “The Judge” (law focus) for roleplay.\n\nI’ve structured them for Philosophy of Law (Hart vs. Fuller) and Introduction to Philosophy (Plato’s Republic as a dungeon). Use a simple cheat sheet for DM notes.\n\nIntroduction to Philosophy: Plato’s Republic (Justice & the Cave as Dungeon)\nDM Setup Narrative: “You awaken chained in the Cave of Shadows—Plato’s Republic unfolds as your prison. Flickering firelight casts puppet illusions on the wall: ‘thrones,’ ‘wars,’ ‘gold.’ A voice (Socrates) whispers: ‘What is justice? Break free or stay comfy?’ Your pre-gen avatars (Guardian, Philosopher, Artisan) must navigate to the sunlight exit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge #\nDescription (DM Presents)\nPlayer Responses & Dice Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n1: Defining Justice (Book I)\n“A shadowy ‘thief’ steals from the ‘rich man’ illusion. The cave echoes: ‘Is justice helping friends or the stronger ruling?’ (Thrasymachus taunt).”\n- Question: “What did Polemarchus/Cephalus say?” (Wisdom roll: 10+ → “Justice as repayment?” Low → Tricked by illusion.)- Suggestion: “Justice is soul harmony” (Plato tease). (Constitution roll: Success → Break one chain; Fail → Headache debuff.)- Others: Debate counters → Roll Perception for “shadow flaws.”\n\n\n2: The Ideal City Escape (Books II-IV)\n“To flee, build a ‘just city’ in the cave: Guardians train, producers craft. But corruption spreads—luxury tempts!”\n- Question: “Why ban poetry/myths?” (Intelligence roll: 13+ → Purify city; Low → Demoralized party.)- Suggestion: “Philosopher-kings rule!” (Charisma roll: Success → Unlock tunnel; Fail → Faction revolt.)- Others: Add classes (waves, auxiliaries) → Group rolls scale city “health.”\n\n\n3: Sunlight Revelation (Books VI-VII, Cave Allegory)\n“You reach the exit: Blinding sun! Puppets were lies. Return to free others? They mock you as mad.”\n- Question: “Forms vs. shadows—what’s real?” (Insight roll: 15+ → Vision quest boon; Low → Blinded retreat.)- Suggestion: “Descend as educators.” (Strength roll: Success → Convert prisoners; Fail → Stoned as heretic.)- Others: Resistance rolls → “Allegory boss”: High total → Party ascends enlightened.\n\n\n\nDM Tips: Use printed “shadow puppets” (simple drawings) as props. Debrief: How does the Cave mirror epistemology? Link to course: “Roll d20: What is reality?”\nThese are plug-and-play—scale difficulty by reading depth. For more (e.g., Descartes’ evil demon as a trap room or Mill’s utilitarianism trolley trap), specify topics! This keeps sessions fun, fair, and deeply philosophical. 🎲"

    "text": "De Musica\n\nWe must not hate what is below us, but rather with God’s help put it in its right place, setting in right order what is below us, ourselves, and what is above us, and not being offended by the lower, but delighting only in the higher.\n\n\nDe Musica is one of Augustine’s lesser known treatises. More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz."

    "text": "Weekly Reflections (5% of final grade, 32 points total):\n\nEight short reflections submitted via Canvas, due Monday at the beginning of week of regular meeting times.\nFormat: Summarize an argument from the week’s reading (3 short sentences) and provide a reflection (2 sentences).\nGrading: Each reflection is scored holistically out of 4 points based on the rubric criteria (considering thesis, premises, support, and student response). Excellent (4 points), Good (3 points), Needs Improvement (2 points), Unacceptable (1 point).\nThe total for all reflections is 32 points.\n\n\n\nQuiz 1 (25% of final grade, 160 points):\n\nA ~1,200-word comprehensive essay covering all course material, due Wed Feb 25, 2026.\nGrading: Evaluated using the rubric with 4 categories, each scored 5–20 points (max 40). See rubric below.\n\n\n\nCritical Reflection 1 (12.5% of final grade, 80 points):\n\nA ~1,500-word essay covering material up to this point, due Mar 23, 2026.\nGrading: Evaluated using the rubric with 4 categories, each scored 5–20 points (max 80). See rubric below.\n\n\n\nPresentation (15% of final grade, 96 points):\nFor this portion of the grade, we will conduct a series of dnd advantures modeled on hard to solve philosophical problems. For instance, in Plato’s Republic, Plato uses the thought of a cave holding prisoners who’ve never seen the outside. All the things they think are objects in the world, really are just crude imitations projected onto a wall in front of them. One escapes and realizes everything he’s been told is a lie. If he goes back, no one will believe him, what should he do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunlight Revelation (Books VI-VII, Cave Allegory)\nYou reach the exit: Blinding sun! Puppets were lies. Return to free others? They mock you as mad.\n- Question: “Forms vs. shadows—what’s real?” (Insight roll: 15+ → Vision quest boon; Low → Blinded retreat.) - Suggestion: “Descend as educators.” (Strength roll: Success → Convert prisoners; Fail → Stoned as heretic.) - Others: Resistance rolls → “Allegory boss”: High total → Party ascends enlightened.\n\n\n\nDates: January 19; February 11; February 25; March 11; March 25\nDownload the DND Addendum Here\n\n\nCritical Reflection 2 (25% of final grade, 160 points):\n\nA ~1,200-word essay analyzing the reading for that period.\nGrading: Evaluated using the rubric with 4 categories, each scored 10–40 points (max 160).

    "text": "In this course, we will use David Chalmer’s book Reality+ to look at questions humans have been asking for thousands of years. While the primary focus of the book is look at one question in particular “Are we in a simulation?”, we use this question to frame others such as: “What does it mean to know that the sky is blue?”, “is murder really wrong?”, “How did I come to know that murder is wrong?”.\nDownload the Syllabus Here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant📢 Important\n\n\n\n\n\n(01/16/2026)\n\n🗓️ Week 02 lecture material is now available!\n\n\n\n\n\n🧑🏻‍🏫 Syllabus\n\nCourse ConvenorCourse InformationReading ScheduleDND AddendumUniversity Supports and Policies\n\n\n Reynolds  Dr. Monty Reynolds Stetson University 📧 mreynolds1@stetson.edu ( at )\nOffice Hours:\n\nWhen: TH 1:00-5:00pm or by appointment\nWhere: Elizabeth Hall 104\nHow to book: Drop in, email, or book via Microsoft Bookings\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Philosophy: Value, Meaning, and Humanity’s Place in the Modern World\nTimes: 10:30-11:45 Days: Mons and Weds or Tues Thurs Where: Davis Hall 209\n\nRequired Texts:\nChalmers, David J.. Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy. United Kingdom: Penguin Books Limited, 2022.\nHere is an amazon link to the book: https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Virtual-Worlds-Problems-Philosophy/dp/0393635805\nThis will also be supplemented with handouts.\n\n\nExpectations:\nCome prepared to engage with assigned readings in class, referencing specific passages as prompted by the instructor.\nBring physical or digital copies of readings to class for annotation and short reflections.\nSubmit all assignments via Canvas by the due date.\nActive participation and regular attendance are essential for success.\nSuccess: Active participation, timely submissions, and attendance are key.\n\n\nGrading Calculation\nDownload the Course Rubric Here\nWeekly Reflections: Each reflection is worth a possible total of 8 points. There are 12 possible reflections. I will only grade 8 or your best reflections.\nReflective Analysis 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\nEssay 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\nPresentation: Your grade in this area depends on your preparation and participation in the DND class meetings. We will use the dnd adventure sheet linked here to gage participation.\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned. The components are as follows:\n\nThere are four possible point values for each category:\n\nAn unacceptable category area is worth 1/4 of the possible points for that category.\nOne that needs improvement is worth 1/2 of the possible points for that category.\nA good submission is worth 3/4s of the possible points for that category.\nAn excellent submission will be awarded full points.\n\nFor each type of assignment, you will be graded on:\n\nIt’s thesis\nThe premises supporting the thesis\nThe support offered for those premises\nYour evaluation of the material.\n\n\nThesis (main conclusion of the reading)\n\nExcellent: A single, clear, obvious statement of your main point.\nGood: The thesis is present and fairly obvious, but not stated in one sharp sentence.\nNeeds Improvement: You have to dig through the paper to find or reconstruct the thesis.\nUnacceptable: No real thesis at all.\n\n\n\nPremises (the reasons supporting the thesis)\n\nExcellent: Every reason is clearly stated (ideally in single sentences), you distinguish premises taken as given from those you defend, you provide sub-arguments for controversial claims, and the basic premises are at least plausibly true.\nGood: Premises are mostly clear (though maybe not always single statements), sub-arguments appear for controversial points, and basic premises are plausible.\nNeeds Improvement: Premises are hard to identify, unclear which are basic vs. defended, missing sub-arguments for controversial claims, or basic premises are questionable.\nUnacceptable: No real premises, or the premises are very likely false.\n\n\n\nSupport (how well, logical, valid, sound?, the premises actually justify the thesis)\n\nExcellent: The premises clearly and strongly support the thesis; the argument is either logically valid or makes the conclusion very plausible.\nGood: Premises support the thesis reasonably well; the argument is valid or at least makes the conclusion plausible.\nNeeds Improvement: Premises only weakly support the thesis; the argument is invalid and the conclusion isn’t really made plausible.\nUnacceptable: The premises do not support the thesis at all.\n\n\n\nStudent Response (how you handle objections/counter-arguments)\n\nExcellent: You thoughtfully address both obvious and less obvious objections, counterexamples, or opposing views, and give original or insightful replies.\nGood: You address the most obvious objections and give reasonable responses.\nNeeds Improvement: You miss some obvious objections, or your responses are weak/empty (e.g., just saying “this is wrong” without explanation).\nUnacceptable: You ignore objections, counterarguments, and opposing positions completely.\n\nThis rubric rewards clear, well-structured, carefully defended, and critically aware philosophical writing. The strongest papers have a sharp thesis, transparent and plausible reasoning, strong logical support, and serious engagement with possible criticisms.\n\n\nAttendance (5% of final grade, 32 points):\n\nBased on unexcused absences throughout the semester.\n\nGrading Scale (equal increments of 8 points):\n\n\n\n0–1\nunexcused absences:\n32 points\n\n\n2\nunexcused absences:\n24 points\n\n\n3–4\nunexcused absences:\n16 points\n\n\n5–6\nunexcused absences:\n8 points\n\n\n6\nunexcused absences:\n0 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust all dates by one for Tuesday Thursday Course\nWeeklies Due Every Monday Starting Jan 19\nThu Jan 14, handouts\nMon Jan 19 MLK Day, no classes\nWed Jan 21, Chapter 2, Simulation Hypothesis\nMon Jan 26, Chapter 3, Knowledge\nWed Jan 28, The external world, ch. 4\nMon Feb 2, ch. 5, Possible realities, bostrom and Moravec\nWed Feb 4, ch. 6, What is Reality?\nMon Fed 9, ch. 7, Is God a hacker in the universe up?\nWed Fed 11, ch. 8 Information, 2nd DND Adventure, Student Led\nMon Feb 16, ch. 9, On Bits\nWed Feb 18, ch. 10, Reality and Virtual Reality\nMon Feb 23, ch. 11, Illusion Machines\nWed Feb 25, Quiz 1\nMon Mar 02, Spring Break\nWed Mar 4, Spring Break\nMon Mar 9, ch. 13 ch. 12, 3rd DND Adventure, Student Led\nWed Mar 11, ch. 14, Mind and body Realism inside a virtual universe\nMon Mar 16, ch. 15, 4th DND Adventure, Student Led\nWed Mar 18, ch. 16, The extended mind hypothsis\nMon Mar 23, ch. 17 Critical Reflection Due\nWed Mar 25, ch. 18, Virtual ethics and intentiality\nMon Mar 30, ch. 19, Social Ontology inside virtual worlds\nWed Apr 1, ch. 20, 5th DND Adventure on Sense and Reference, Student Led\nMon Apr 6, ch. 21, Cause and effect inside virtual systems\nWed Apr 8, ch. 22, Mathematical, physical and cultural structualism\nMon Apr 13, ch. 23, Virtual Eden?\nWed Apr 15, ch. 24, Brains in a Vat\nMon Apr 20, TBD\nWed Apr 22, TBD\nMon Apr 27, TBD\nWed Apr 29, last day of classes, Final Quiz\nPaper Due on Day of Final Quiz (Submit on Canvas)\n\n\nDownload here:\nTo grade your participation in the dnd adventures, keep your adventure tracker sheets: found here\nYour points prove you participated, you get full credit for turning in a complete score card.\n\nOverall Course Setup\n\nGroup Structure: By the second week, students form small groups of 5 members each.\nRotating Dungeon Master (DM) Role: Every group member gets one turn to act as the\n\nDungeon Master (DM) for a full session/day.\n\nThis distributes workload fairly—no one is stuck doing all the prep.\nThe DM takes ownership of that day’s reading/topic, transforming it into a D&D-style adventure.\n\n\n\nSession Format (When a Student is DM)\n\n1. Presentation of the Reading\nThe DM presents the assigned philosophical text (e.g., a reading on core intro topics like knowledge/reality) structured as a D&D adventure.\n\nThink narrative framing: The group is a party of adventurers (or avatars embodying philosophical positions).\nYou are friends in a virtual simulation.\nThe reading becomes the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., do you leave or stay, or a riddle posed by a sphinx representing a philosopher.\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially (like encounters in a dungeon).\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou are the philosophy instructor who is not allowed to teach Plato.\nA trolley-like scenario in a fantasy context → Apply ethics/law theories.\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nAny group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response in character (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player rolls dice (typically a d20 + relevant modifier, like “Intelligence for reasoning” or “Charisma for persuasion”) to determine the outcome/strength of their idea.\nSuccess → Advances the “quest,” strengthens the argument, or reveals new insight.\nFailure → Complication, objection, or setback (e.g., a logical fallacy is exposed).\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOther group members get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., alternative interpretations, edge cases, or objections from the reading).\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (like a traditional DM).\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to philosophy in the real world?\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nExamples of D&D-Style Challenges\nHere are concrete examples of challenges tailored to the rotating DM format. Each is designed for a ~5-player group session (45-60 minutes), drawing directly from key readings. The DM narrates in a immersive, fantasy voice (not necessary), presents challenges one at a time, and adjudicates dice rolls (e.g., d20 + “Wisdom” for insight, “Charisma” for persuasion).\n\nSuccess thresholds: DC 10-15 (easy for basic grasp, hard for nuance). High roll = insight/reward; low = complication/objection.\nPlayer actions: Ask a question (probe text) or suggest a solution (defend position). Others chime in with counters/considerations.\nPre-gen characters: Assign avatars like “The Skeptic” (epistemology focus) or “The Judge” (law focus) for roleplay.\n\n\nIntroduction to Philosophy: Plato’s Republic (Justice & the Cave as Dungeon)\nDM Setup Narrative: “You awaken chained in the Cave of Shadows—Plato’s Republic unfolds as your prison. Flickering firelight casts puppet illusions on the wall: ‘thrones,’ ‘wars,’ ‘gold.’ A voice (Socrates) whispers: ‘What is justice? Break free or stay comfy?’ Your pre-gen avatars (Guardian, Philosopher, Artisan) must navigate to the sunlight exit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge #\nDescription (DM Presents)\nPlayer Responses & Dice Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n1: Defining Justice (Book I)\n“A shadowy ‘thief’ steals from the ‘rich man’ illusion. The cave echoes: ‘Is justice helping friends or the stronger ruling?’ (Thrasymachus taunt).”\n- Question: “What did Polemarchus/Cephalus say?” (Wisdom roll: 10+ → “Justice as repayment?” Low → Tricked by illusion.)- Suggestion: “Justice is soul harmony” (Plato tease). (Constitution roll: Success → Break one chain; Fail → Headache debuff.)- Others: Debate counters → Roll Perception for “shadow flaws.”\n\n\n2: The Ideal City Escape (Books II-IV)\n“To flee, build a ‘just city’ in the cave: Guardians train, producers craft. But corruption spreads—luxury tempts!”\n- Question: “Why ban poetry/myths?” (Intelligence roll: 13+ → Purify city; Low → Demoralized party.)- Suggestion: “Philosopher-kings rule!” (Charisma roll: Success → Unlock tunnel; Fail → Faction revolt.)- Others: Add classes (waves, auxiliaries) → Group rolls scale city “health.”\n\n\n3: Sunlight Revelation (Books VI-VII, Cave Allegory)\n“You reach the exit: Blinding sun! Puppets were lies. Return to free others? They mock you as mad.”\n- Question: “Forms vs. shadows—what’s real?” (Insight roll: 15+ → Vision quest boon; Low → Blinded retreat.)- Suggestion: “Descend as educators.” (Strength roll: Success → Convert prisoners; Fail → Stoned as heretic.)- Others: Resistance rolls → “Allegory boss”: High total → Party ascends enlightened.\n\n\n\nThese are plug-and-play—scale difficulty by reading depth. For more (e.g., Descartes’ evil demon as a trap room or Mill’s utilitarianism trolley trap), specify topics! This keeps sessions fun, fair, and deeply philosophical. 🎲\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Note: Oral appeals for grade changes are NOT accepted. If you feel that you have an extremely strong case for a grade change, you may submit a one-page essay explaining your reasons to me within one week of your work being returned.\nA.Honor Code: University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. Any attempt at academic cheating will be referred to the Honor Council. I expect you to abide by the Honor Code that we have adopted here at Stetson. Please sign all work “Pledged, your name.” University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. As a community of intellectual inquirers, we are all committed to academic integrity and honesty. The Stetson University Student Government Association, on its own initiative, recently drafted a proposal for an honor code, a powerful statement of the student body’s commitment to this community of honor and integrity. For this reason, all work that you turn in must be your own. Any contribution from others must be clearly acknowledged. Unauthorized assistance on exams (take-home as well as in-class), research papers, or projects can be neither given nor received. The University has fully endorsed its honor system and abides by its precepts. If you have questions regarding the method/procedure for citing the work of others, please feel free to consult us.\nThe Department of Philosophy expects academic honesty of all students; we expect all students to abide by Stetson’s honor code and to adhere to the honor system. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, altering or misusing documents, plagiarizing, misrepresentation, knowingly providing false information, colluding, and other forms of cheating. Students should read and follow Stetson’s definitions and policies on ‘Academic Honesty,’ the honor code, and the honor system in Connections: The Campus Life Handbook and Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with these definitions and policies; ignorance of them is not an acceptable excuse for violating them. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be referred to the Academic Honor Council, as per departmental policy.\nThe honor code can be found online at the following address:http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/ http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/\nB.Assignment standards: Late Work: All assignments must be handed in on time: late work will be docked a half-letter grade per day unless you get my approval for an extension before the due date. (Student athletes and others on school business: please, be advised to turn your assignments in BEFORE you leave, not after you return). No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without documented University accepted excuse (and they will differ from the ones given in class). This includes group quizzes.\nC.Accommodation: Writing Center: Many students experience difficulty writing research papers. For that reason, Stetson University supports a Writing Center, located on the Second Floor of the Library. I have found that one or two visits to the Writing Center can make a tremendous difference in the quality of a paper. If you find that you have trouble with your written assignments, I strongly encourage you to seek the help of the Writing Center. The Academic Success Center provides academic and disability resources for all Stetson University Students. Students who anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a course should meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (386-822-7127; www.stetson.edu/asc). You and I, and the ASC, will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Sheridan’s writing center hours: W 2-6, F 12-3.\nThe ASC also coordinates free tutoring on campus for students. You can meet with a tutor to review principles, learn content-specific study strategies, and enhance content area knowledge. To review the tutoring options available and schedules, please see our website www.stetson.edu/asc/tutoring/php.\n2.Counseling: Counseling: College can be extremely stressful for students, especially if this is the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period of time or if there are other pressures that you are facing. For this reason, you may find it helpful to consult the University Counseling Center. Here is their contact information:\nPhone number: 386-822-8900\nLocation: The office is located in Griffith Hall\nOffice hours: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nIf a student experiences a mental health emergency after hours, they can simply call Public Safety (386-822-7300) and ask to speak with the on-call counselor.\nWe are staffed with qualified professional counselors who are trained to support and guide students through difficult transitions, experiences, and feelings.\nCounseling is confidential and free of charge for all currently enrolled Stetson University students.\nIf experiencing a mental health crisis, you may also call 386-822-8740 to be connected to Volusia County Crisis Response Team: If having thoughts of harming yourself or others, select option one. For all other mental health needs select option nine.\nFor medical emergencies call 911.\nSchedule of Readings/Assignments: subject to change as needed, it is YOUR responsibility to regularly check blackboard for announcements.\nStudents are required to check their Stetson email and Canvas accounts frequently, daily if possible. Do not use technology as an excuse for not completing an assignment/quiz or for submitting an assignment/quiz late or improperly. Late assignments/submissions are not accepted.\nAll students will be asked to verify in an online quiz that they agree and will abide by the procedures and policies presented in this syllabus. If you do not feel you can abide by the course rules, please drop the course.\nAny recordings of this class (audio, video, or otherwise) may ONLY be used for personal academic use. Recordings may NOT be shared with other people without written consent from the professor. The information contained in recordings constitutes intellectual property and is protected under federal copyright laws. This information may NOT be published or quoted without the express written consent of the professor and without giving proper identification and credit to the professor. Recordings of this class may not be used in any way against the faculty member, teaching assistant, other lecturer, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class. Violation of these stipulations will result in being reported to the Office of Community Standards.\nD. Food Insecurity: At Stetson University, we are committed to supporting students’ well-being, including ensuring access to nutritious food. If you are experiencing a lack of access to safe and nutritious food, the Hatters Helping Hatters Food Pantry is her to help. The Food Pantry is a free, no-questions-asked supplemental food resource for all Stetson students, staff & faculty.

This means that everything in nature has a purpose or end (telos) that it is directed towards.\nThis include:\n\nends\ngoals\nand purposes\n\n\nBut what are these and do we necessarily have access to them? The person who intends to rob a bank because it is enjoyable, is that person really pursuing the goal of robbery? Or is the goal something else? Is the goal of robbery really enjoyment? If so, then what is the goal of enjoyment? Is it pleasure? If so, then what is the goal of pleasure? Is it happiness? If so, then what is the goal of happiness?"

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

    "text": "Article 4\n\nOn the contrary, Happiness is the perfect good. But power is most imperfect. For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), “the power of man cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety.” And further on: “Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still more?” Therefore, happiness does not consist in power.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

But honor is not in the honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore, happiness does not consist in honor.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

For those who receive false fame, must needs blush at their own praise.” Therefore, man’s happiness does not consist in fame or glory.

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine."

More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz."

    "title": "Books I-IV of Plato’s Republic",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Justice in the ideal city and in the ideal soul\nThe tripartite nature of the city and the soul\n\n\nIn the Republic, Plato tells a story. In the beginning of the story, Socrates, his mentor, is on his way back from the Piraeus after attending a religious festival. The Piraeuseans had recently imported a religious cult which worshiped the Tracian goddess Bendis. A question is raised. What is justice? Over time, varying accounts of justice are offered, each of which Socrates raises objections to (Bk I, 352d-354a). In order to explain his ideal of true justice, Socrates imagines the ideal city (BK IV, 434d-435a). This city is comprised of three classes of persons. Justice is achieved when each class, performs that role in the city, to which they are best suited. The working class is motivated by the pursuit of material wealth (558d-559c), the guardian class is motivated by honor (BK III, 414b), and the ruling class is motivated by truth (BK III, 412b-414b).\nAccordingly, justice in the human soul, which is tripartite, is achieved when each part of the soul performs that role to which it is best suited. The appetites, perform those roles necessary for the base functions of the human person, food, procreation, and other necessary motor functions. The passions, or emotions are mobilized with respect to honor or respect, and its pursuit. Reason, which ought to rule over both the appetites and emotions, is concerned with an unyielding pursuit of truth.\n\n\n\n\nWhat virtues belong to each class?\nWhat is the first class that Plato discusses?\n\n\nOddly enough, in Bk III, Plato leaves off any discussion of what he calls poetry, because even though he is convinced that poetry disrupts the training of the just sole, he cannot say how it does so until he has defined justice. This part of the project takes from Bk III to Bk IVX to do. While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue. Yet, the most they are capable of is imitation. This brings us to the primary argument in Bk X of the Republic. What is this class of thing which poetry belongs to?\n\n\n\nWhat makes a good teacher of virtue?\nWhat makes a good poet?\n\n\nUnlike other craftsmen, say a carpenter, the artist merely imitates what the craftsman makes, including virtue. But this is only as their mere opinions would lead them to believe of its nature. Imitation involves the mere imitation of craftsmanship.\nFirst, there is the nature of a bed as created by say a god (X, 597b). In exercising their craft, the carpenter makes a bed, which is based on the original form of a bed. Though the craftsman makes a bed, the ideal form of the bed is made by a god. A painter, finally then, exercises a different craft, and their resulting product, likewise differs from the god and the carpenter.\nImportantly here, while the god makes the form of the bed, and the carpenter makes an idealization of this form, the painter, and other artists including poets, only imitate what the craftsmen makes. As such, the products of the artists are at a third remove from the truth (597e).\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses of Objects\nWhat are their purposes?\nWhat are they made of?\nHow do we understand them?\n\n\nWe are looking at a particular class of object. These are objects which are objects that are thought to represent other artifacts, namely those created by artisans.\nPaintings, novels, stories, plays, films, and games. Consider Seurat’s Sunday on the Island of La Grande Jate, or Dicken’s Tale of two Cities, or Hitchcock’s North by Northwest.\nKendall (walt90?) in his book Mimesis as Make-Believe, defines the question nicely. These objects are important for our lives and culture. But what are they? What are they made of? How do they work? What purposes do they serve and how do they serve them? What means do they use to serve these purposes? How do people understand and appreciate them?\nWalton will go on to argue that the kinds of objects that we refer to as mimetic, are best understood as props in games of make believe.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Concepts\nWhat does Tragedy Represent?\n\n\nImportantly however, Plato’s main target is not the imitation of objects, beds, tables, chairs, etc. Rather, Plato’s primary target is the representation of virtue and other abstract constructs. Socrates and his student Plato, grew up on the narratives provided them by the Greek tragedians, poets, and other literary figures of their day. As pointed out by Martha (nuss86i?), Greek tragedy of the sort that concerns Plato:\nWhat about the Sydney Opera House, paintings by Jason Pollack, or images created by game developers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngood people being ruined because of things that just happen to them, things that they do not control. … and ordinary fact of human life. (nuss86i?)\n\n\nWhile Plato’s concern is the existence of human virtue here, the above preoccupation does not express Plato’s criticism fully. People do not typically loose their virtue because of some environmental catastrophe. The environment might obscure some important fact that contributed to the person’s decision for instance, meaning the person involved might be excused in part because of ignorance. Additional, we often see great acts of courage, beneficence, selflessness in response to environment catastrophes. But, Greek tragedy did something else as well:\n\n\nBut . . .\n\nWhat is Vice?\nVicious Action done in ignorance or something else?\n\n\n\nTragedy also … shows good people doing bad things, things otherwise repugnant to their ethical character and commitments, because of circumstances whose origin does not lie with them.\n\n\n\nThese lie beyond simple ignorance. Here, the person is fully knowledgeable about what they are doing. They are not being physically or psychologically coerced. Rather, tragedy presents a character as being able to make one of two equally bad choices. The outcome of such stories, is for their audiences to question the nature of human goodness. What can possibly count as human virtue, virtue that is attributable to the person and not the environment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I lack, say the virtue of courage, but possess, say the virtue of painting, could I paint an accurate portrait of said virtue?\nIf I possess, say the virtue of courage, but not the virtue of painting, could I paint an accurate portrait of said virtue?\n\n\nThe reason is this: We hear some people say that poets know all crafts, all human affairs concerned with virtue and vice, and all about the gods as well. They say that if a good poet produces find poetry, he must have knowledge of the things he writes about, or else he wouldn’t be able to produce it at all. [BK X, 598e]\n\n\n\nBoth the teacher of virtue and poet are skilled to some extent. To be skilled, you must first have certain abilities and knowledge. The question which remains is whether what one needs to know in order to be a good teacher of virtue is the same as what one needs to know to be a good poet.\n\nPlato argues these are not analogous. What say you?\n\n\nPlato argues these are not analogous."

But this is only as their mere opinions would lead them to believe of its nature. Imitation involves the mere imitation of craftsmanship.\nFirst, there is the nature of a bed as created by say a god (X, 597b). In exercising their craft, the carpenter makes a bed, which is based on the original form of a bed. Though the craftsman makes a bed, the ideal form of the bed is made by a god. A painter, finally then, exercises a different craft, and their resulting product, likewise differs from the god and the carpenter.\nImportantly here, while the god makes the form of the bed, and the carpenter makes an idealization of this form, the painter, and other artists including poets, only imitate what the craftsmen makes. As such, the products of the artists are at a third remove from the truth (597e).\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses of Objects\nWhat are their purposes?\nWhat are they made of?\nHow do we understand them?\n\n\nWe are looking at a particular class of object. These are objects which are objects that are thought to represent other artifacts, namely those created by artisans.\nPaintings, novels, stories, plays, films, and games. Consider Seurat’s Sunday on the Island of La Grande Jate, or Dicken’s Tale of two Cities, or Hitchcock’s North by Northwest.\nKendall (walt90?) in his book Mimesis as Make-Believe, defines the question nicely. These objects are important for our lives and culture. But what are they? What are they made of? How do they work? What purposes do they serve and how do they serve them? What means do they use to serve these purposes? How do people understand and appreciate them?\nWalton will go on to argue that the kinds of objects that we refer to as mimetic, are best understood as props in games of make believe.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Concepts\nWhat does Tragedy Represent?\n\n\nImportantly however, Plato’s main target is not the imitation of objects, beds, tables, chairs, etc. Rather, Plato’s primary target is the representation of virtue and other abstract constructs. Socrates and his student Plato, grew up on the narratives provided them by the Greek tragedians, poets, and other literary figures of their day. As pointed out by Martha (nuss86i?), Greek tragedy of the sort that concerns Plato:\nWhat about the Sydney Opera House, paintings by Jason Pollack, or images created by game developers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngood people being ruined because of things that just happen to them, things that they do not control. … and ordinary fact of human life. (nuss86i?)\n\n\nWhile Plato’s concern is the existence of human virtue here, the above preoccupation does not express Plato’s criticism fully. People do not typically loose their virtue because of some environmental catastrophe. The environment might obscure some important fact that contributed to the person’s decision for instance, meaning the person involved might be excused in part because of ignorance. Additional, we often see great acts of courage, beneficence, selflessness in response to environment catastrophes. But, Greek tragedy did something else as well:\n\n\nBut . . .\n\nWhat is Vice?\nVicious Action done in ignorance or something else?\n\n\n\nTragedy also … shows good people doing bad things, things otherwise repugnant to their ethical character and commitments, because of circumstances whose origin does not lie with them.\n\n\n\nThese lie beyond simple ignorance. Here, the person is fully knowledgeable about what they are doing. They are not being physically or psychologically coerced. Rather, tragedy presents a character as being able to make one of two equally bad choices. The outcome of such stories, is for their audiences to question the nature of human goodness. What can possibly count as human virtue, virtue that is attributable to the person and not the environment?"

They say that if a good poet produces find poetry, he must have knowledge of the things he writes about, or else he wouldn’t be able to produce it at all.

For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good.

For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness.

    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine."

    "text": "De Musica\n\nWe must not hate what is below us, but rather with God’s help put it in its right place, setting in right order what is below us, ourselves, and what is above us, and not being offended by the lower, but delighting only in the higher.\n\n\nDe Musica is one of Augustine’s lesser known treatises. More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz."

However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz."

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), “the power of man cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety.” And further on: “Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still more?” Therefore, happiness does not consist in power.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine.",

    "text": "De Musica\n\nWe must not hate what is below us, but rather with God’s help put it in its right place, setting in right order what is below us, ourselves, and what is above us, and not being offended by the lower, but delighting only in the higher.\n\n\nDe Musica is one of Augustine’s lesser known treatises. More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz."

For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

    "text": "Article 6\nI answer that, […] in every thing, that which pertains to its essence is distinct from its proper accident: thus in man it is one thing that he is a mortal rational animal, and another that he is a risible animal. We must therefore consider that every delight is a proper accident resulting from happiness, or from some part of happiness; since the reason that a man is delighted is that he has some fitting good, either in reality, or in hope, or at least in memory […] Therefore, it is evident that neither is delight, which results from the perfect good, the very essence of happiness, but something resulting therefrom as its proper accident."

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "section": "Article 7",
    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

    "text": "Article 8\nIt is impossible for any created good to constitute man’s happiness. For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine."

    "text": "Course Information\nIntroduction to Philosophy: Value, Meaning, and Humanity’s Place in the Modern World\nTimes: 10:30-11:45 Days: Mons and Weds or Tues Thurs Where: Davis Hall 209\n\nRequired Texts:\nChalmers, David J.. Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy. United Kingdom: Penguin Books Limited, 2022.\nHere is an amazon link to the book: https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Virtual-Worlds-Problems-Philosophy/dp/0393635805\nThis will also be supplemented with handouts.\n\n\nExpectations:\nCome prepared to engage with assigned readings in class, referencing specific passages as prompted by the instructor.\nBring physical or digital copies of readings to class for annotation and short reflections.\nSubmit all assignments via Canvas by the due date.\nActive participation and regular attendance are essential for success.\nSuccess: Active participation, timely submissions, and attendance are key.\n\n\nGrading Calculation\nDownload the Course Rubric Here\nWeekly Reflections: Each reflection is worth a possible total of 8 points. There are 12 possible reflections. I will only grade 8 or your best reflections.\nReflective Analysis 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\nEssay 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\nPresentation: Your grade in this area depends on your preparation and participation in the DND class meetings. We will use the dnd adventure sheet linked here to gage participation.\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned. The components are as follows:\n\nThere are four possible point values for each category:\n\nAn unacceptable category area is worth 1/4 of the possible points for that category.\nOne that needs improvement is worth 1/2 of the possible points for that category.\nA good submission is worth 3/4s of the possible points for that category.\nAn excellent submission will be awarded full points.\n\nFor each type of assignment, you will be graded on:\n\nIt’s thesis\nThe premises supporting the thesis\nThe support offered for those premises\nYour evaluation of the material.\n\n\nThesis (main conclusion of the reading)\n\nExcellent: A single, clear, obvious statement of your main point.\nGood: The thesis is present and fairly obvious, but not stated in one sharp sentence.\nNeeds Improvement: You have to dig through the paper to find or reconstruct the thesis.\nUnacceptable: No real thesis at all.\n\n\n\nPremises (the reasons supporting the thesis)\n\nExcellent: Every reason is clearly stated (ideally in single sentences), you distinguish premises taken as given from those you defend, you provide sub-arguments for controversial claims, and the basic premises are at least plausibly true.\nGood: Premises are mostly clear (though maybe not always single statements), sub-arguments appear for controversial points, and basic premises are plausible.\nNeeds Improvement: Premises are hard to identify, unclear which are basic vs. defended, missing sub-arguments for controversial claims, or basic premises are questionable.\nUnacceptable: No real premises, or the premises are very likely false.\n\n\n\nSupport (how well, logical, valid, sound?, the premises actually justify the thesis)\n\nExcellent: The premises clearly and strongly support the thesis; the argument is either logically valid or makes the conclusion very plausible.\nGood: Premises support the thesis reasonably well; the argument is valid or at least makes the conclusion plausible.\nNeeds Improvement: Premises only weakly support the thesis; the argument is invalid and the conclusion isn’t really made plausible.\nUnacceptable: The premises do not support the thesis at all.\n\n\n\nStudent Response (how you handle objections/counter-arguments)\n\nExcellent: You thoughtfully address both obvious and less obvious objections, counterexamples, or opposing views, and give original or insightful replies.\nGood: You address the most obvious objections and give reasonable responses.\nNeeds Improvement: You miss some obvious objections, or your responses are weak/empty (e.g., just saying “this is wrong” without explanation).\nUnacceptable: You ignore objections, counterarguments, and opposing positions completely.\n\nThis rubric rewards clear, well-structured, carefully defended, and critically aware philosophical writing. The strongest papers have a sharp thesis, transparent and plausible reasoning, strong logical support, and serious engagement with possible criticisms.\n\n\nAttendance (5% of final grade, 32 points):\n\nBased on unexcused absences throughout the semester.\n\nGrading Scale (equal increments of 8 points):\n\n\n\n0–1\nunexcused absences:\n32 points\n\n\n2\nunexcused absences:\n24 points\n\n\n3–4\nunexcused absences:\n16 points\n\n\n5–6\nunexcused absences:\n8 points\n\n\n6\nunexcused absences:\n0 points",

    "text": "University Supports and Policies\nPlease Note: Oral appeals for grade changes are NOT accepted. If you feel that you have an extremely strong case for a grade change, you may submit a one-page essay explaining your reasons to me within one week of your work being returned.\nA.Honor Code: University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. Any attempt at academic cheating will be referred to the Honor Council. I expect you to abide by the Honor Code that we have adopted here at Stetson. Please sign all work “Pledged, your name.” University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. As a community of intellectual inquirers, we are all committed to academic integrity and honesty. The Stetson University Student Government Association, on its own initiative, recently drafted a proposal for an honor code, a powerful statement of the student body’s commitment to this community of honor and integrity. For this reason, all work that you turn in must be your own. Any contribution from others must be clearly acknowledged. Unauthorized assistance on exams (take-home as well as in-class), research papers, or projects can be neither given nor received. The University has fully endorsed its honor system and abides by its precepts. If you have questions regarding the method/procedure for citing the work of others, please feel free to consult us.\nThe Department of Philosophy expects academic honesty of all students; we expect all students to abide by Stetson’s honor code and to adhere to the honor system. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, altering or misusing documents, plagiarizing, misrepresentation, knowingly providing false information, colluding, and other forms of cheating. Students should read and follow Stetson’s definitions and policies on ‘Academic Honesty,’ the honor code, and the honor system in Connections: The Campus Life Handbook and Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with these definitions and policies; ignorance of them is not an acceptable excuse for violating them. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be referred to the Academic Honor Council, as per departmental policy. The honor code can be found online at the following address:http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/ http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/\nB.Assignment standards: Late Work: All assignments must be handed in on time: late work will be docked a half-letter grade per day unless you get my approval for an extension before the due date. (Student athletes and others on school business: please, be advised to turn your assignments in BEFORE you leave, not after you return). No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without documented University accepted excuse (and they will differ from the ones given in class). This includes group quizzes.\nC.Accommodation: Writing Center: Many students experience difficulty writing research papers. For that reason, Stetson University supports a Writing Center, located on the Second Floor of the Library. I have found that one or two visits to the Writing Center can make a tremendous difference in the quality of a paper. If you find that you have trouble with your written assignments, I strongly encourage you to seek the help of the Writing Center. The Academic Success Center provides academic and disability resources for all Stetson University Students. Students who anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a course should meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (386-822-7127; www.stetson.edu/asc). You and I, and the ASC, will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Sheridan’s writing center hours: W 2-6, F 12-3.\nThe ASC also coordinates free tutoring on campus for students. You can meet with a tutor to review principles, learn content-specific study strategies, and enhance content area knowledge. To review the tutoring options available and schedules, please see our website www.stetson.edu/asc/tutoring/php.\n2.Counseling: Counseling: College can be extremely stressful for students, especially if this is the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period of time or if there are other pressures that you are facing. For this reason, you may find it helpful to consult the University Counseling Center. Here is their contact information:\nPhone number: 386-822-8900\nLocation: The office is located in Griffith Hall\nOffice hours: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nIf a student experiences a mental health emergency after hours, they can simply call Public Safety (386-822-7300) and ask to speak with the on-call counselor.\nWe are staffed with qualified professional counselors who are trained to support and guide students through difficult transitions, experiences, and feelings.\nCounseling is confidential and free of charge for all currently enrolled Stetson University students.\nIf experiencing a mental health crisis, you may also call 386-822-8740 to be connected to Volusia County Crisis Response Team: If having thoughts of harming yourself or others, select option one. For all other mental health needs select option nine.\nFor medical emergencies call 911.\nSchedule of Readings/Assignments: subject to change as needed, it is YOUR responsibility to regularly check blackboard for announcements.\nStudents are required to check their Stetson email and Canvas accounts frequently, daily if possible. Do not use technology as an excuse for not completing an assignment/quiz or for submitting an assignment/quiz late or improperly. Late assignments/submissions are not accepted.\nAll students will be asked to verify in an online quiz that they agree and will abide by the procedures and policies presented in this syllabus. If you do not feel you can abide by the course rules, please drop the course.\nAny recordings of this class (audio, video, or otherwise) may ONLY be used for personal academic use. Recordings may NOT be shared with other people without written consent from the professor. The information contained in recordings constitutes intellectual property and is protected under federal copyright laws. This information may NOT be published or quoted without the express written consent of the professor and without giving proper identification and credit to the professor. Recordings of this class may not be used in any way against the faculty member, teaching assistant, other lecturer, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class. Violation of these stipulations will result in being reported to the Office of Community Standards.\nD. Food Insecurity: At Stetson University, we are committed to supporting students’ well-being, including ensuring access to nutritious food. If you are experiencing a lack of access to safe and nutritious food, the Hatters Helping Hatters Food Pantry is her to help. The Food Pantry is a free, no-questions-asked supplemental food resource for all Stetson students, staff & faculty. Food Pantry location:\n\nCarlton Union Building (CUB 278), open 24 hours.",
